# React-Native-Financial-Monitoring
React Native brings React's declarative UI framework to iOS and Android. With React Native, you use native UI controls and have full access to the native platform.
Declarative. React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
Component-Based. Build encapsulated components that manage their state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
Developer Velocity. See local changes in seconds. Changes to JavaScript code can be live reloaded without rebuilding the native app.
Portability. Reuse code across iOS, Android, and other platforms.

React Native is developed and supported by many companies and individual core contributors. Find out more in our ecosystem overview.

Requirements
React Native apps can target iOS 12.4 and Android 5.0 (API 21) or newer. You can use Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system, although creating and running iOS apps is limited to macOS. Tools such as Expo can be used to solve this problem.
System Setup:
1. Install android studio
2. Set up environment variables
  в ~/.bashrc записать 
  export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
  export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
  export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
